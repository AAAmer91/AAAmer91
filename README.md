## PoultryHelper Demo
PoultryHelper is a full-stack project I built to help poultry farmers optimize their operations. It includes a live web application with tools for:

- Uniformity & Coefficient of Variation Calculator – quickly assess flock weight uniformity.
- Feed Analyzer – input ingredient weights of desired feed formula & more and see nutrient composition.
- Least Cost Optimizer – choose a diet (e.g., starter, grower, finisher), and compute the cheapest feed formula based on live up-to-date prices.
- Ingredient Composition – select an ingredient to view its detailed nutrient breakdown.
- Feed Prices – view daily prices for key ingredients like yellow corn, soybean meal, wheat bran, etc.
