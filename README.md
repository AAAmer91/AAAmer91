## PoultryHelper Demo
PoultryHelper is a full-stack project I built to help poultry farmers optimize their operations. It includes a live web application with tools for:

- Uniformity & Coefficient of Variation Calculator – quickly assess flock weight uniformity using min/max weights【626823520046387†screenshot】.
- Feed Analyzer – input ingredient weights for corn, soybean meal, gluten meal & more and see nutrient composition【907503542250230†screenshot】.
- Least Cost Optimizer – choose a diet (e.g., starter, grower, finisher), set crude protein & energy requirements, and compute the cheapest feed formula【686586695097181†screenshot】.
- Ingredient Composition – select an ingredient to view its detailed nutrient breakdown【865619001933962†screenshot】.
- Feed Prices – view daily prices for key ingredients like yellow corn, soybean meal, wheat bran, etc.【924948282368050†screenshot】.
- Articles – browse educational articles on feed economics and nutrition【142092845503194†screenshot】.
